"""
The application under evaluation: the Caldova knowledge agent.

This file is PROVIDED - you don't edit it. It wraps the agent you already have
(from Lab B, or from `python ../setup/bootstrap_agent.py`) in the shape the
evaluate() API expects for a *target*: something callable that takes a row of
your dataset and returns the application's output for that row.

evaluate() calls this once per line of caldova_eval.jsonl, passing the columns
of that line as keyword arguments, and merges the returned dictionary back into
the row as `target.*`. So returning {"response": ...} makes `${target.response}`
available to every evaluator.
