"""
Preflight check for the Caldova enterprise-knowledge lab.

Each task in this lab can be completed on its own. Before you start a task,
run this script to confirm your .env file has everything that task needs.

Run it from the lab's starter code folder —
Labfiles/B-integrate-agents-with-enterprise-knowledge-and-m365/Python, the folder
you open in VS Code, where your virtual environment and .env live:

    python ../setup/check_env.py --task 4

This script uses only the Python standard library, so it works before you run
'pip install' and without the lab virtual environment active. Keep it that way:
it is the one script learners are most likely to run in a bare environment.

It never changes anything — it only reads your .env and tells you what (if
anything) is missing, so you can fix it before running the task.

Tasks and what they need:

    Task 1  (core, code)   PROJECT_ENDPOINT, AGENT_NAME   (the Foundry IQ agent)
    Task 2  (portal)       no .env needed — you publish to Teams in the portal
    Task 3  (portal)       no .env needed — you publish to M365 Copilot in the portal
    Task 4  (code)         PROJECT_ENDPOINT, MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
