# Task 2 — Connect a remote MCP server

*Part of the **Build and extend AI agents** lab. New here? Start with [Getting started](A0-getting-started.md).*

> **Set up (start here):** This task needs a Foundry project and the starter code. If you
> haven't already, complete [Getting started](A0-getting-started.md) to create your project,
> clone the code, and set `PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` in `Python/.env`.
> Then, from the `Python` folder you opened in VS Code, verify you're ready:

```
python ../setup/check_env.py --task 2
```

> **Continuing from a previous task?** If you just finished an earlier task in the same
> `Python` folder, your project, virtual environment, and `.env` are already set — go
> straight to **Connect the agent to the MCP server** below.

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** lets an agent discover and call tools hosted by a
server. Caldova's platform team is rebuilding the supply chain system on Azure. In this
separate supporting exercise, you create a platform documentation agent and connect it to
the **Microsoft Learn Docs** remote MCP server. The agent can then retrieve trusted,
up-to-date Azure documentation on demand.

<summary>What is MCP?</summary>
<div class="concept-body" markdown="1">

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** solves this by letting an agent discover tools at
runtime. With MCP, tools live on a **server** that acts as a live catalog. Your agent
(through a **client**) asks the server what tools are available and calls them on demand.

A local function runs inside your application. An MCP tool can run on another server and
be shared by many clients. In this task, the documentation tool is hosted remotely by
Microsoft Learn.

Open the `Python` folder and activate the virtual environment from [Getting started](A0-getting-started.md) (`.\labenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`), then continue below.

### Connect the agent to the MCP server

Open **remote_mcp_agent.py** and add code at each commented placeholder.

> **Tip**: As you add code, keep the indentation aligned with the comments.

1. **Add references**:

    ```python
    # Add references
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
    from azure.ai.projects.models import PromptAgentDefinition, MCPTool
    from openai.types.responses.response_input_param import McpApprovalResponse, ResponseInputParam
    ```

1. **Connect to the agents client**:

    ```python
    # Connect to the agents client
    with (
        DefaultAzureCredential() as credential,
        AIProjectClient(endpoint=project_endpoint, credential=credential) as project_client,
        project_client.get_openai_client() as openai_client,
    ):
    ```

1. **Initialize agent MCP tool** — this points the agent at the Microsoft Learn Docs MCP server:

    ```python
    # Initialize agent MCP tool
    mcp_tool = MCPTool(
        server_label="api-specs",
        server_url="https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp",
        require_approval="always",
    )
    ```

1. **Create a new agent with the MCP tool**:

    ```python
    # Create a new agent with the MCP tool
    agent = project_client.agents.create_version(
        agent_name="platform-docs-agent",
        definition=PromptAgentDefinition(
            model=model_deployment,
            instructions="You are a platform engineering assistant for Caldova. Use the available MCP tools to look up trusted Azure documentation and help the team build and operate the supply chain platform.",
            tools=[mcp_tool],
        ),
    )
    print(f"Agent created (id: {agent.id}, name: {agent.name}, version: {agent.version})")
    ```

1. **Create a conversation thread**:

    ```python
    # Create a conversation thread
    conversation = openai_client.conversations.create()
    print(f"Created conversation (id: {conversation.id})")
    ```

1. **Send initial request that will trigger the MCP tool**:

    ```python
    # Send initial request that will trigger the MCP tool
    response = openai_client.responses.create(
        conversation=conversation.id,
        input="Give me the Azure CLI commands to deploy our product catalog API to an Azure Container App with a managed identity.",
        extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
    )
    ```

1. **Process any MCP approval requests** — because the tool requires approval, the agent
    pauses and asks permission before each call. This loop auto-approves each request:

    <details markdown="1" class="concept">
    <summary>Why does an MCP tool require approval?</summary>
    <div class="concept-body" markdown="1">

    An MCP call can send information to another service or trigger an external action.
    Approval creates a trust boundary: the application can inspect the requested server and
    tool before allowing the call. This sample auto-approves requests only from the expected
    `api-specs` server so you can practice the approval flow without a user interface.

    </div>
    </details>

    ```python
    # Process any MCP approval requests that were generated
    while True:
        input_list: ResponseInputParam = []
        for item in response.output:
            if item.type == "mcp_approval_request":
                if item.server_label == "api-specs" and item.id:
                    input_list.append(
                        McpApprovalResponse(
                            type="mcp_approval_response",
                            approve=True,
                            approval_request_id=item.id,
                        )
                    )

        # No more approvals needed -> the agent has produced its final response
        if not input_list:
            break

        response = openai_client.responses.create(
            input=input_list,
            previous_response_id=response.id,
            extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
        )

    print(f"\nAgent response: {response.output_text}")
    ```

1. **Clean up the agent version** so you don't leave test agents behind:

    ```python
    # Clean up resources by deleting the agent version
    project_client.agents.delete_version(agent_name=agent.name, agent_version=agent.version)
    print("Agent deleted")
    ```

1. Save the file (**Ctrl+S**).

### Run and test

1. In the terminal, sign in and run the app:

    ```
    az login
    ```

    ```
    python remote_mcp_agent.py
    ```

1. Watch the agent create itself, call the MCP tool (approved automatically by your loop), and answer using live documentation. You should see output similar to:

    ```
    Agent created (id: platform-docs-agent:2, name: platform-docs-agent, version: 2)
    Created conversation (id: conv_...)

    Agent response: Here are Azure CLI commands to create an Azure Container App with a managed identity:
    ...
    Agent deleted
    ```

1. Try changing the `input` string to ask about a different Azure service, and run again.

When you're finished, enter `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment.
