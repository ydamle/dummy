# Work IQ - Workplace intelligence for AI agents

In this lab, you'll build an AI agent that accesses your Microsoft 365 workplace data using **Work IQ** - Microsoft's contextual intelligence layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). You'll create a workplace intelligence agent that can prepare for meetings, track projects, extract action items, and answer workplace questions using real M365 data.

This lab takes approximately **40** minutes.

> **Note:** This is an **optional/advanced lab** that requires a Microsoft 365 Copilot license. It's designed for enterprise learners, Microsoft employees, or those with M365 Copilot access. Standard M365 accounts without Copilot will not work.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have:

- Basic understanding of AI agents and the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Microsoft 365 with Copilot License**
- IT admin approval for Work IQ (organizational accounts only)
- [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or later installed
- [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed (authenticated with `az login`)
- Active M365 data (emails, meetings, Teams chats) to query

> \* Python 3.14 isn't supported yet: some dependencies have no 3.14 build. This lab was tested with Python 3.13.12.

> **Important:** Work IQ **only works** with Microsoft 365 Copilot-enabled accounts. You cannot complete this lab without Copilot.

## Install Work IQ

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Install Work IQ globally via npm:

    ```bash
   npm install -g @microsoft/workiq
    ```

3. Accept the End User License Agreement:

    ```bash
   workiq accept-eula
    ```

4. Test your Work IQ installation:

    ```bash
   workiq ask -q "What meetings do I have today?"
    ```

5. **If the test succeeds** - You'll see meeting information from your M365 calendar. Continue to the next task!

6. **If you see "Admin consent required":**

   - The command will display a consent URL
   - Send this URL to your IT administrator with the message: "I need Work IQ access for the Microsoft Learn AI Agents lab"
   - Wait for admin approval, then retry the test command

7. **If you see "No M365 Copilot license":**

   - Unfortunately, you cannot complete this lab without a Copilot license
   - You can still read through the instructions to understand the concepts
   - Consider this lab optional and return to it when you have Copilot access

## Prepare to develop an app in Visual Studio Code

Now let's use Visual Studio Code to develop an app. The code files for your app have been provided in a GitHub repo.

1. Start Visual Studio Code, and open a terminal window.

2. Enter the command to clone the repo to a local folder (it doesn't matter which folder):

    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents.git
    ```

3. When the repository has been cloned, open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

    > **Note**: If Visual Studio Code shows you a pop-up message prompting you to trust the code you are opening, select **Yes, I trust the authors** to continue.

4. Wait while additional files are installed to support the Python code projects in the repo (if prompted).

    > **Note**: If you are prompted to install required assets to build and debug, select **Not Now**.

5. In the **Explorer** pane, expand the **Labfiles/05b-work-iq-integration/Python** folder.

    The provided files include application code, configuration settings, and the agent client starter code.

6. In the terminal, enter the command to create a Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
   python -m venv venv
    ```

7. Activate the virtual environment:

   **Windows:**

    ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

   **macOS/Linux:**

    ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
    ```

8. Install required Python packages:

    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

9. Configure your `.env` file:

   In the lab folder, open the `.env` file and update it with your Foundry project endpoint:

    ```env
   PROJECT_ENDPOINT=https://your-project.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/your-id
   MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-5
    ```

   > **Tip:** To get your endpoint: In VS Code, open the **Foundry Toolkit** extension, right-click on your active project, and select **Copy Endpoint**. The Foundry Toolkit is included in the Foundry Toolkit for VS Code extension.

### Verify setup

Ensure you have:

- Work IQ installed and accessible (`workiq --version` works)
- Admin consent approved (or personal M365 account with Copilot)
- `workiq_lab.py` - Main interactive application
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies installed
- `.env` file configured with your project endpoint

## Explore Workplace Intelligence Scenarios

In this exercise, you'll run a unified interactive application that demonstrates five workplace intelligence scenarios using a single AI agent with Work IQ tools.

### Launch the lab application

1. Ensure you're in the lab directory with your virtual environment activated.

2. Run the lab application:

    ```bash
   python workiq_lab.py
    ```

3. The application will:
   - Validate Work IQ setup
   - Connect to your Microsoft Foundry project
   - Initialize the Work IQ MCP client
   - Create a workplace intelligence agent
   - Display an interactive menu with 5 scenarios

### Meeting Prep scenario

This scenario helps you prepare for meetings by gathering relevant context.

1. From the main menu, select **1 - Meeting Prep**.

2. When prompted, enter a meeting topic or time, such as:
   - "my 2pm meeting"
   - "Q4 Planning session"
   - "team standup"

3. The agent will:
   - Find your meeting details (time, attendees, agenda)
   - Search recent emails about the topic
   - Look for previous meetings on this subject
   - Summarize key points and decisions
   - Suggest discussion points

4. Review the output and note:
   - How sources are cited (emails, meetings, dates)
   - How the agent synthesizes information from multiple sources
   - The time saved compared to manual searching

**Reflection:** How does this differ from manually searching your email and calendar?

### Project Status scenario

This scenario tracks project updates across your workplace tools.

1. From the main menu, select **2 - Project Status**.

2. Enter a project name you're working on, such as:
   - "Website redesign"
   - "Q1 OKRs"
   - "Customer onboarding"

3. The agent will:
   - Search emails and Teams messages about the project
   - Find related meetings and their outcomes
   - Identify recent decisions and changes
   - List blockers or issues mentioned
   - Summarize next steps and deadlines

4. Analyze the results:
   - How comprehensive is the status update?
   - What sources did the agent use?
   - Could this be built with traditional APIs? What's the development effort difference?

### Action Items scenario

This scenario extracts your open tasks from various sources.

1. From the main menu, select **3 - Action Items**.

2. Choose a time range (or press Enter for "this week"):
   - "today"
   - "last 3 days"
   - "this month"

3. The agent will:
   - Search meeting notes for assigned action items
   - Look for task-related emails sent to you
   - Check Teams messages where you were mentioned
   - Identify items with deadlines
   - Prioritize by urgency if possible

4. Examine the output:
   - Are all your action items captured?
   - How accurate is the prioritization?
   - Where were action items found (meetings, emails, Teams)?

### Combined Intelligence scenario

This scenario demonstrates using **both** Work IQ (workplace data) and Foundry IQ (knowledge base) together.

> **Note:** This scenario requires Azure AI Search configured in your Foundry project with an indexed knowledge base.

1. From the main menu, select **4 - Combined Intelligence**.

2. Enter a topic that exists in both your workplace discussions and official documentation:
   - "remote work policy"
   - "expense reporting"
   - "security guidelines"

3. The agent will:
   - Search workplace data (Work IQ): emails, meetings, Teams discussions
   - Search knowledge base (Foundry IQ): official docs, policies, procedures
   - Compare workplace discussions with official documentation
   - Identify gaps or inconsistencies
   - Provide a comprehensive summary with labeled sources

4. Compare the two perspectives:
   - What's documented officially vs. discussed informally?
   - Are there any contradictions?
   - Which source is more up-to-date?

**Key Insight:**

- **Work IQ** tells you what people are actually doing and saying
- **Foundry IQ** tells you what's officially documented
- **Together** they provide complete context for decision-making

### Custom Query scenario

This scenario lets you explore your workplace data with your own questions.

1. From the main menu, select **5 - Custom Query**.

2. Try different types of workplace questions:

   **Email searches:**

    ```
   Find emails about the budget from my manager
    ```

   **Meeting summaries:**

    ```
   What was decided in yesterday's standup?
    ```

   **Team activity:**

    ```
   What did the engineering team discuss this week?
    ```

   **Document discovery:**

    ```
   Show me shared documents about security policies
    ```

3. Experiment with:
   - Different time ranges
   - Different data sources (emails vs. meetings vs. Teams)
   - Different levels of specificity
   - Follow-up questions to refine results

4. Note what works well:
   - Specific queries usually work better than vague ones
   - Including time ranges improves relevance
   - Names and keywords help narrow results

## Explore and Experiment

Now that you've completed all scenarios, take 5-10 minutes to explore on your own.

### Test edge cases

1. Try queries about data you don't have - how does the agent respond?

2. Ask ambiguous questions - how does the agent handle them?

3. Search for very old information - what are the limits?

### Explore different query styles

1. **Very specific**: "Find the email from John about Q3 budget sent on January 15th"

2. **Very broad**: "Tell me about recent developments"

3. **Comparative**: "Compare this week's discussions to last week's"

## Understanding the Code

Let's examine the key patterns used in this lab.

### Pattern 1: Work IQ MCP Client Initialization

```python
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

# Store server parameters for reuse
self.workiq_server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@microsoft/workiq", "mcp"]
)

# Fetch available tools from Work IQ MCP server
async def _fetch():
    async with stdio_client(self.workiq_server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            tools_result = await session.list_tools()
            return tools_result.tools

raw_tools = asyncio.run(_fetch())
```

Rather than maintaining a persistent connection, a new MCP session is opened per operation. `StdioServerParameters` stores the command and arguments used to launch the Work IQ MCP server subprocess each time.

### Pattern 2: Creating Agent with Work IQ Tools

```python
from azure.ai.projects.models import PromptAgentDefinition, FunctionTool

# Convert MCP tools to FunctionTool objects
workiq_tools = [
    FunctionTool(
        name=tool.name,
        description=tool.description,
        parameters=tool.inputSchema,
    )
    for tool in raw_tools
]

# Create agent with Work IQ tools
self.agent = self.project_client.agents.create_version(
    agent_name="workplace-intelligence-agent",
    definition=PromptAgentDefinition(
        model=self.model_deployment,
        instructions="You are a workplace intelligence assistant...",
        tools=workiq_tools  # Work IQ tools added here
    )
)

# Keep a map of raw tools for lookup during execution
self.raw_tools_map = {tool.name: tool for tool in raw_tools}
```

Each MCP tool is wrapped in a `FunctionTool` object and passed to a `PromptAgentDefinition`. The raw tools map enables efficient lookup when the agent calls a tool by name.

### Pattern 3: Executing Queries with Responses API

```python
# Create conversation
conversation = self.openai_client.conversations.create(
    items=[{"type": "message", "role": "user", "content": query}]
)

# Create response with agent
response = self.openai_client.responses.create(
    conversation=conversation.id,
    extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": self.agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}}
)
```

This uses the Responses API pattern (not the old Runs/Threads pattern) for cleaner agent execution.

### Pattern 4: Tool Call Loop

After the initial response, the agent may request one or more Work IQ tool calls. These must be executed and fed back to continue the conversation:

```python
from openai.types.responses.response_input_param import FunctionCallOutput

while True:
    if response.status == "failed":
        break

    input_list = []
    for item in response.output:
        if item.type == "function_call":
            kwargs = json.loads(item.arguments)

            # Call the Work IQ tool via MCP
            async def _execute():
                async with stdio_client(self.workiq_server_params) as (read, write):
                    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
                        await session.initialize()
                        return await session.call_tool(item.name, kwargs)

            result = asyncio.run(_execute())
            input_list.append(
                FunctionCallOutput(
                    type="function_call_output",
                    call_id=item.call_id,
                    output=result.content[0].text,
                )
            )

    if input_list:
        # Send tool results back and continue
        response = self.openai_client.responses.create(
            input=input_list,
            previous_response_id=response.id,
            extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": self.agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}}
        )
    else:
        break  # No more tool calls - final response ready
```

The loop continues until the agent produces a response with no pending function calls, at which point `response.output_text` contains the final answer.

## Clean Up

The lab automatically cleans up the agent when you exit:

```python
self.openai_client.agents.delete_version(
    agent_name=self.agent.name,
    version=self.agent.version
)
```

No Azure resources are created in this lab (Work IQ uses your M365 license), so no additional cleanup is needed.

## Troubleshooting

### "Work IQ command not found"

**Solution:** Install Work IQ:

```bash
npm install -g @microsoft/workiq
```

### "Admin consent required"

**Solution:**

1. Run `workiq mcp` to get the consent URL
2. Send to your IT admin for approval
3. Or use a personal M365 account with Copilot

### "No M365 Copilot license"

**Solution:** This lab requires Copilot. Either:

- Purchase M365 Copilot license ($30/month)
- Use organizational account with Copilot
- Read through the lab to understand concepts without hands-on

### "MCP server not responding"

**Solution:** Test Work IQ directly:

```bash
workiq ask -q "What meetings do I have?"
```

If this fails, reinstall:

```bash
npm install -g @microsoft/workiq
```

### "No data returned"

**Solution:**

- Ensure your M365 account has emails, meetings, Teams activity
- Try broader queries
- Check if your query matches your actual data
